## Business problem

This app predicts if an applicant will be approved for a credit card or not. Each time there is a hard enquiry your credit score is affected negatively. This app predict the probability of being approved without affecting your credit score. This app can be used by applicant who wants to find out if they will be approved for a credit card without affecting their credit score.
## Data source

- [Kaggle credit card approval prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction)

## Methods

- Exploratory data analysis
- Bivariate analysis
- Multivariate correlation
- S3 bucket model hosting
- Model deployment
## Tech Stack

- Python (refer to requirement.txt for the packages used in this project)
- Streamlit (interface for the model)
- AWS S3 (model storage)

Top 3 models (with default parameters)

| Model     	                | Recall score 	|
|-------------------	        |------------------	|
| Support vector machine     	| 88% 	            |
| Gradient boosting    	        | 90% 	            |
| Adaboost               	    | 79% 	            |


- ***The final model used is: Gradient boosting***
- ***Metrics used: Recall***
- Why choose precision as metrics:
  Since the objective of this problem is to minimize the risk of credit default for the financial institution, the metrics to use depends on the current economical situation:

  - During the time of a bull market (when the economy is expending), people feel wealthy and usually are employed. Money is usually cheap and the risk of default is low. The financial institution is able to handle the risk of default therefore is not very strict on giving out credit. The financial institution can handle a number of bad clients as long as the vast majority of applicants are good clients (aka those who payback their credit).In this case, having a good recall (sensitivity) is ideal.
  - During a bear market (when the economy is contracting), people loose their jobs and their money through the stock market. Many people struggle to meet their financial obligations. The financial institution therefore tend to be more conservative on giving out credit or loans. The financial institution can't afford to give out credit to clients who won't be able to pay back their credit. The financial institution would rather have a smaller number of good clients even if it means that some good clients where denied credit, and ideally not have any bad client. In this case, having a good precision (specificity) is desirable.

    Note: There is always a trade-off between precision and recall. Choosing the right metrics depends on the problem you are solving.

    Conclusion: In our case, since we are in the longest bull market (not including the March 2020 flash crash), we will use recall as our metric.


## Lessons learned and recommendation

- Based on the analysis on this project, we found out that income, family member count and employment length, are the most predictive features to determine if an applicant will be approved for a credit card or not. Other features like age and working employment status are also useful. The least useful features are: type of dwelling and car ownership.
- Recommendation would be to focus more on the most predictive feature when looking at the applicant profile, and pay less attention on the least predictive features.
## Limitation and what can be improved

- Combine this model with with a regression model to predict how much of a credit limit an applicant will be approved for.
- Hyperparameter tuning with grid search or random search.
- Better interpretation of the chi-square test
- Retrain the model without the least predictive features
- Hyperparameter tuning: I used RandomSearchCV to save time but could be improved by couple of % with GridSearchCV.

## Deployment on streamlit

To deploy this project on streamlit share, follow these steps:

- first, make sure you upload your files on Github, including a requirements.txt file
- go to [streamlit share](https://share.streamlit.io/)
- login with Github, Google, etc.
- click on new app button
- select the Github repo name, branch, python file with the streamlit codes
- click advanced settings, select python version 3.9 and add the secret keys if your model is stored on AWS or GCP bucket
- then save and deploy!
